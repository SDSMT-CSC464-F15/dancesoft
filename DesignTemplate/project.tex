\chapter{Project Overview}
This section provides some information with regards to the 
team roles, project management, and phase overview.[MB]

\section{Team Members and Roles}
The DanceSoft team consist of two members, Marcus Berger and Dicheng Wu.

Marcus Berger(Scrum Master/Development Team) -  As a member of a two person team the roles for this project blend together significantly. Both team members mostly do equal shares of all work types. As the primary manager of the DanceSoft Trello board, Marcus has mostly taken on the role of scrum master within the group. However his primary role is still development.

Dicheng Wu(Development Team) - Dicheng's primary role as with both members of the team, is development of the software. However like the other members since the team is so small each member of the two person team must be able to fill all needed roles within the team.

Dr. Jeff Mcgough(Product Owner) - While not a working member of the team Dr. Mcgough is a secondary scrum master and product owner to the group due the small size of the team. Main duties in this role include talking to the client about what is needed, and making sure the team stays on task and is going in the correct direction based on the clients needs 

Author notation will be identified by [MB] for Marcus and [DW] for Dicheng at the start of
major sections (ex: after heading 2.0 above). Subsections within the main sections assumed to be by the
same author. [MB] 


\section{Project  Management Approach}
The client requires a weekly meeting every Wednesday at 2:00 p.m. to check on the progress of the system. These meeting vary on topic and length depending on the needs of the project and the status of task. The senior design class requires that this project be completed in six sprint that are all roughly three weeks long, with a week long results period after each one. Another project requirement is the presentations that are required by the senior design class. These presentation occurs twice every semester usually after the first and last sprint each semester. Each presentation cover the content of the project up to that point, and updates on topics such as risk mitigation, budget, and current prototypes. Lastly it was requested by Dr. Mcgough as part of senior design and as the client that we provide him with access to the Github repository for the project and the Trello board for check in purposes.


\section{Stakeholder Information}

The stakeholder and sponsoring customer for this project is Dr. Jeff McGough a computer science professor at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology and the vice president of the Academy of Dance Arts in Rapid City, South Dakota.
Well not the sponsor of the project Dr. McGough's wife, Julie McFarland is also a key part of the customer base and a stakeholder as the owner and artistic director of the Academy. [MB] 


\subsection{Customer or End User (Product Owner)}
The primary end user for this product is Julie McFarland and her employees to manage the Academy of Dance Arts. Julie well not playing a direct role in product development is able to convey the academy's needs through Dr. McGough.

Dr. Jeff McGough is the primary point of contact in the project. He assumes the role of scrum master at times and drives the product backlog and provides more details on product backlog materials during the weekly meeting with the development team. 

\subsection{Management or Instructor (Scrum Master)}
Dr. Jeff McGough is the primary point of contact in the project. He assumes the role of scrum master at times and drives the product backlog and provides more details on product backlog materials during the weekly meeting with the development team.


\subsection{Developers --Testers}
The DanceSoft team consist of two members, Marcus Berger and Dicheng Wu, who are both primarily developers and testers. due to the fact that the team is so small. All development roles are shared between the two team members.


\section{Budget}
Describe the budget for the project including gifted equipment and salaries for 
people on the project.

\section{Intellectual Property and Licensing}
Describe the IP ownership and issues surrounding IP.

\section{Sprint  Overview}
This project will be implemented in phases, the phases follow. [MB]

\subsection{Initial User Story and Requirements Gathering}
This phase consist of meaning and discussing the user stories and requirements with the product owner. The product owner also lays out limitations and constraints for the project. More information can be found in section \bf 3.0 Requirements

\subsection{Database Creation and Starting Pages}
During this phase the database schema will be constructed and implemented, being sure to keep the schema as concise as possible. The goal is to generate a database that can effective support the needed functions and GUI connectivity. After the database is constructed, the team will move on to the starting landing pages which will be jumping off pages for functionality creation. These page will almost certainly be modified as phases progress.

\subsection{Prototyping and Testing}
This phase will compose the bulk of the project as the first development of the functionality requested by the project owner are constructed. As the prototype progresses check ins with the client will be conducted to be as sure as possible that the team stays on track. Pages will be tested as the pages are constructed.

\subsection{Development Updates and Testing}
This phase will consist of updates to existing functions, updates, and prototyping updated, new, or misunderstood functions. Testing will be conducted as updates are made to ensure new pages work, and updated pages retain requested function. During this phase user stories and requirements should move to final completion.

\subsection{Final Testing, Production, and Delivery}
During this phase the last bit of testing on the remaining functionality will be conducted. After this the final production needs will be completed, this may consist of final deployment or other steps depending on the state of the project at this time. Lastly the project will be handed over to the client for delivery and the senior design fair. By this point the product itself will live on the box provided by the client and a production server. Access Information, logs, and user guides and manuals will be provided, with the user guide as both pdf files and psychical copies.
