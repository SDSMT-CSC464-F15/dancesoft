	The DanceSoft product developed by the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology senior design team of Marcus Berger and Dicheng Wu is a proof of concept for an administrative software to run the day to day activities of the Rapid City Academy of Dance Arts. The teams overall goal is to provide a proof of concept to the client Dr. Jeff McGough, to show that a viable software is indeed possible to meet the needs of the Academy and eventually through continued iteration by other senior design groups or by outside entities the project will replace the software currently in use at the Rapid City Academy of Dance Arts\\
	
	The product will demonstrate a set of core functionalities that will be used to run the Academy, these functions include adding students, and teachers, assigning classes to teachers, registering students, ability to produce schedules and roll sheets, and a very rudimentary billing system that will be a blueprint for future iterations of the software.  Other functions needed to complete this core functionality are also included in the system. 
The projects provides an admin interface where the teachers who are registered as admin can do several data manipulation task for the system. These task include managing classes, students and teachers, updating Academy personal information, and dealing with a simple billing system. The project also provided a teacher interface where teachers registered in the system are able to manage their needs. Teachers are able to view student information such as name, guardian, address, and emergency contact. Teachers are also able to search classes, produce student and teacher schedules, and produce class role sheets. Lastly teachers are able to modify their personal information, this includes a form to change fields such as address, and medical information, and the user can also modify name, date of birth and other field should mistakes be made when the teacher is first entered. Also the teacher is able to change their log in credentials and enter their hours for viewing by system admins.\\

	As a proof of concept this software is meant to give the client a minimum viable product, or more likely provide a blueprint for a future system iteration whether that be a future senior design project, or a contract software. In accordance with the clients request this product is not meant to be an industrial software at the completion of the senior design project. The overall goal remains to give the client an idea of the possibilities of a full industrial Academy of Dance Arts software.
