\chapter{Project Overview}
This section provides some information with regards to the 
team roles, project management, and phase overview.[MB]

\section{Team Members and Roles}
The DanceSoft team consist of two members, Marcus Berger and Dicheng Wu.

Marcus Berger(Scrum Master/Development Team) -  As a member of a two person team the roles for this project blend together significantly. Both team members mostly do equal shares of all work types. As the primary manager of the DanceSoft Trello board, Marcus had mostly taken on the role of scrum master within the group. However his primary role is still development of DanceSoft.

Dicheng Wu(Development Team) - Dicheng's primary role as with both members of the team, is development of the software. However like the other members since the team is so small each member of the two person team must be able to fill all needed roles within the team.

Dr. Jeff Mcgough(Product Owner) - While not a working member of the team Dr. Mcgough is a secondary scrum master and product owner to the group due the small size of the team. Main duties in this role include talking to the client about what is needed, and making sure the team stays on task and is going in the correct direction based on the clients needs .

Author notation will be identified by [MB] for Marcus and [DW] for Dicheng at the start of
major sections (ex: after heading 2.0 above). Subsections within the main sections assumed to be by the
same author. [MB] 


\section{Project Management Approach}
The client requires a weekly meeting every Wednesday at 2:00 p.m. to check on the progress of the system during the fall 2015 semester at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. During the spring 2016 semester the team meeting changed to Tuesdays at 2:00 p.m. and Thursdays at 3:00 p.m. if necessary. These meeting vary on topic and length depending on the needs of the project and the status of task. The senior design class requires that this project be completed in six sprint that are all roughly three weeks long, with a week long results period after each one. Another project requirement is the presentations that are required by the senior design class. These presentation occurs twice every semester usually after the first and last sprint each semester. Each presentation cover the content of the project up to that point, and updates on topics such as risk mitigation, budget, and current prototypes. Lastly it was requested by Dr. McGough as part of senior design and as the client that we provide him with access to the Github repository for the project and the Trello board for check in purposes.

The internal team management was mostly was mostly done by Marcus Berger and Dr. McGough. Marcus used the free service Trello to manage the tasks that the team needed to complete. As the project progressed the team had to reevaluate the management approach as the DanceSofts project requirements changed. After sprint 3 it was decided that due to time left for the project that the management of the student interface would need to be finish in a future iteration.    


\section{Stakeholder Information}

The stakeholder and sponsoring customer for this project is Dr. Jeff McGough a computer science professor at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology and the vice president of the Academy of Dance Arts in Rapid City, South Dakota.


Well not the sponsor of the project Dr. McGough's wife, Julie McFarland is also a key part of the customer base and a stakeholder as the owner and artistic director of the Academy. Other academy members while not directly related also share a stock in the project development as the software directly processes and modify data given to the academy. Students and teachers will not have the access to direct evaluation of the various iterations of the DanceSoft project. However as the project nears completion in future senior design classes or however the clients choose to proceed, these group could be effected by the uses of and updates to the software. Therefore they have a secondary stake in the projects various iterations. 


\subsection{Customer or End User (Product Owner)}
The primary end user for this product is Julie McFarland and her employees to manage the Academy of Dance Arts. Julie well not playing a direct role in product development is able to convey the academy's needs through Dr. McGough. Dr. Jeff McGough is the primary point of contact in the project. He assumes the role of scrum master at times and drives the product backlog while providing more details on product backlog materials during the weekly meeting with the development team. 

\subsection{Management or Instructor (Scrum Master)}
Dr. Jeff McGough is the primary point of contact in the project. He assumes the role of scrum master at times and drives the product backlog and provides more details on product backlog materials during the weekly meeting with the development team. He also acts as the assessment for project progress. This means that as the project progressed Dr. McGough is able to reevaluate and reestablish requirements as the project needed or was requested by the client. 


\subsection{Developers --Testers}
The DanceSoft team consist of two members, Marcus Berger and Dicheng Wu, who are both primarily developers and testers. Due to the fact that the team is only two members, all development roles are shared between the two team members. The teams job is to develop, test, fix and adapt the various request and requirements given by the client/scrum master Dr. McGough. As developers the team takes the user stories and develops a backlog for each sprint. Then the teams job is to take these user stories and produce the code needed to complete each backlog entry.

After the backlog entry has been complete it is the developers job to test and error check the functions to make sure that the function completes all its needed tasks, in the way the team wants. Also testing is done to make sure the files don't create any problems with the rest of the software. Testing is covered in more detail in the testing section of this document.

\section{Budget}
There was no budget or monetary compensation for this project. When the project was initially laid out there was an idea for a budget that would be used for a Linux box. The Linux box would have been used to store the system on a local device. However as the requirement were brought down and redefined to an iteration of the project, rather then a full complete project, it became clear that the project would not reach a deployment state where a local machine was necessary. Thus the budget for this iteration is zero, but in future iterations the project may reach a state where a defined budget is again required. 
Monetary compensation for this project follow the guidelines laid out in the DanceSoft Software Contract. The team will be given and accept no form of compensation for the work on the DanceSoft or any related project. This is in accordance with the conditions of the project, client, and the senior design class.

\section{Intellectual Property and Licensing}
Describe the IP ownership and issues surrounding IP.

\section{Sprint  Overview}
This project will be implemented in phases, the phases follow. [MB]

\subsection{Sprint 1: Initial User Story and Requirements Gathering}
This phase consist of meetings and discussing the user stories and requirements with the product owner. The product owner also lays out limitations and constraints for the project. More information can be found in section \bf 3.0 Requirements \rm

Also tackled during this phase was the research conducted into the tools the team were going to use for the project. There were three main areas the team needed to tackle to decide the frameworks for the project. First the team need to pick the programming language that would be used for the project. Two main languages were analysed, Python and Swift. Swift is the Mac native language resentlly released by Apple Inc. the benifits found for Swift was it nativity to the Mac OSX and it would be the easiest to intergrate into Mac. However since Swift was relativly new the team would have to take even more time to learn and new language, and since the client did not know Swift it would be harder to anailize. Python had the advantage of being a language that is more univerisly known, both to the team, the client, and the online community that the team could turn to for support. Due to this and a few other factors laid out in more detail in \bf Sprint Report 1 \rm the team choose Python as the programming language for the project.

The other two areas of research were database and interface framework. The team looked to PyQt, Kivi, Tkinter, and other graphical interface frameworks. The team decided after looking at each one that due to the ease of use and some companies listing GUI experience, that the team would use PyQt as the framework for the interface. Then the DanceSoft team looked into database software. After looking at both SQL and non-SQL datebase option the team went with a MySQL database for the storage. As with programming language, the research results are laid out in the \bf Sprint Report 1 \rm   

\subsection{Sprint 2: Database Creation and Starting Pages}
During this phase the database schema was constructed and implemented, being sure to keep the schema as concise as possible. The goal is to generate a database that can effective support the needed functions and GUI connectivity. After the database is constructed, the team will move on to the starting landing pages which will be jumping off pages for functionality creation. These page will almost certainly be modified as phases progress.

\subsection{Sprint 3: Functionality Creation }
This phase will compose the bulk of the project as the first development of the functionality requested by the project owner are constructed. As the prototype progresses check ins with the client will be conducted to be as sure as possible that the team stays on track. Pages will be tested as the pages are constructed.

\subsection{Sprint 4: Development Updates and Payroll/Billing}
This phase will consist of updates to existing functions, updates, and prototyping updated, new, or misunderstood functions. Testing will be conducted as updates are made to ensure new pages work, and updated pages retain requested function. During this phase user stories and requirements should move to final completion.

\subsection{Sprint 5: Updates Bug Fixes and Functionality}
During this phase the last bit of testing on the remaining functionality will be conducted. After this the final production needs will be completed, this may consist of final deployment or other steps depending on the state of the project at this time. Lastly the project will be handed over to the client for delivery and the senior design fair. By this point the product itself will live on the box provided by the client and a production server. Access Information, logs, and user guides and manuals will be provided, with the user guide as both pdf files and psychical copies.

\subsection{Sprint 6: Updates, Fixes, and Iteration Packaging}
