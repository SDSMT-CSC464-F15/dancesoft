\section{Mission Statement}
The mission of the DanceSoft team is to create a efficient and effective system for the Academy of Dance Arts. So data can be managed clearly and easily to manage the academy's day to day needs. [MB]

\section{Elevator Pitch}
The DanceSoft project is a data management software for the Academy of Dance Arts in Rapid City. The project aims to produce a simple and more effective data management tool then what is currently in use at the academy. This will be accomplished through the use of a database and a simple user friendly interface, which will allow faculty and students to easily accomplish their needs, whether that's registering for a class, getting a role sheet or just general people management. DanceSoft will provide effective management tools so people spend less time at their computer, and more time dancing. [MB]
