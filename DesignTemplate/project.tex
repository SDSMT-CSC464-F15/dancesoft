\chapter{Project Overview}
This section provides some housekeeping type of information with regard to the 
team, project, etc. 



\section{Team Members and Roles}
The DanceSoft team consist of two members, Marcus Berger and Dicheng Wu.

Marcus Berger(Scrum Master/Development Team) -  As a member of a two person team the roles for this project blend together significantly. Both team members mostly do equal shares of all work types. As the primary manager of the DanceSoft trello board, Marcus has mostly taken on the role of scrum master within the group. However his primary role is still development.

Dicheng Wu(Development Team) - Dicheng's primary role as with both members of the team, is development of the software. However like the other members since the team is so small each member of the two person team must be able to fill all needed roles within the team.

Dr. Jeff Mcgough(Product Owner) - While not a working member of the team Dr. Mcgough is a secondary scrum master and product owner to the group due the small size of the team. Main duties in this role include talking to the client about what is needed, and making sure the team stays on task and is going in the correct direction based on the clients needs 


\section{Project  Management Approach}
This project is managed using several service and an Agile sprint based methodology. The sprints which range in purpose from research to development are three weeks long with a week after each sprint for review and possible presentations to the client. The project is broken into several users stories, which are then broken down into a project backlog of task for development. The stories and backlog are discussed  in a later section of this document. Project management tools used by the team are Github, for source control and code management, and Trello for sprint and backlog management. Trello provide a list of task to be accomplished in each sprint and the ability to see modified tasks and keep track of team members current assignments.


\section{Phase  Overview}


If the system will be implemented in phases, describe those phases/sub-phases (design, 
implementation, testing, delivery) and the various milestones in this section. 
 This section should also contain a correlation between the phases of development 
and the associated versioning of the system, i.e. major version, minor version, 
revision. 

\section{Terminology and Acronyms}
Provide a list of terms used in the document that warrant definition.  Consider 
industry or domain specific terms and acronyms as well as system specific.
