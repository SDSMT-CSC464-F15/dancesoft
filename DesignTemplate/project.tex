\chapter{Project Overview}
This section provides some information with regards to the 
team roles, project management, and phase overview.[MB]

\section{Team Members and Roles}
The DanceSoft team consist of two members, Marcus Berger and Dicheng Wu.

Marcus Berger(Scrum Master/Development Team) -  As a member of a two person team the roles for this project blend together significantly. Both team members mostly do equal shares of all work types. As the primary manager of the DanceSoft Trello board, Marcus has mostly taken on the role of scrum master within the group. However his primary role is still development.

Dicheng Wu(Development Team) - Dicheng's primary role as with both members of the team, is development of the software. However like the other members since the team is so small each member of the two person team must be able to fill all needed roles within the team.

Dr. Jeff Mcgough(Product Owner) - While not a working member of the team Dr. Mcgough is a secondary scrum master and product owner to the group due the small size of the team. Main duties in this role include talking to the client about what is needed, and making sure the team stays on task and is going in the correct direction based on the clients needs 

Author notation will be identified by [MB] for Marcus and [DW] for Dicheng at the start of
major sections (ex: after heading 2.0 above). Subsections within the main sections assumed to be by the
same author. [MB]



\section{Project  Management Approach}
This project is managed using several service and an Agile sprint based methodology. The sprints which range in purpose from research to development are three weeks long with a week after each sprint for review and possible presentations to the client. The project is broken into several users stories, which are then broken down into a project backlog of task for development. The stories and backlog are discussed  in a later section of this document. 
Project management tools used by the team are Github, for source control and code management, and Trello for sprint and backlog management. Trello provide a list of task to be accomplished in each sprint and the ability to see modified tasks and keep track of team members current assignments. The task assign in each sprint are decided be the team with some input from Dr. McGough as a secondary scrum master. These assignment can be altered or changed based on product owner input. Sprint reports are sent to Dr. McGough for both project owner and grading purposes at the end of each sprint.
Scheduled Meeting occur every Tuesday and Thursday from 10:00-12:00, other times are assigned as the team finds necessary. The team also has a weekly meeting with the product owner Dr. Jeff McGough every Wednesday at 2:00 where the progress of the project, the next steps, and any lingering questions about the project can be addressed.

\section{Phase  Overview}
This project will be implemented in phases, the phases follow. [MB]

\subsection{Initial User Story and Requirements Gathering}
This phase consist of meaning and discussing the user stories and requirements with the product owner. The product owner also lays out limitations and constraints for the project. More information can be found in section \bf 3.0 Requirements

\subsection{Database Creation and Starting Pages}
During this phase the database schema will be constructed and implemented, being sure to keep the schema as concise as possible. The goal is to generate a database that can effective support the needed functions and GUI connectivity. After the database is constructed, the team will move on to the starting landing pages which will be jumping off pages for functionality creation. These page will almost certainly be modified as phases progress.

\subsection{Prototyping and Testing}
This phase will compose the bulk of the project as the first development of the functionality requested by the project owner are constructed. As the prototype progresses check ins with the client will be conducted to be as sure as possible that the team stays on track. Pages will be tested as the pages are constructed.

\subsection{Development Updates and Testing}
This phase will consist of updates to existing functions, updates, and prototyping updated, new, or misunderstood functions. Testing will be conducted as updates are made to ensure new pages work, and updated pages retain requested function. During this phase user stories and requirements should move to final completion.

\subsection{Final Testing, Production, and Delivery}
During this phase the last bit of testing on the remaining functionality will be conducted. After this the final production needs will be completed, this may consist of final deployment or other steps depending on the state of the project at this time. Lastly the project will be handed over to the client for delivery and the senior design fair. By this point the product itself will live on the box provided by the client and a production server. Access Information, logs, and user guides and manuals will be provided, with the user guide as both pdf files and psychical copies.
