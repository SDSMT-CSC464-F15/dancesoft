\chapter{System  and Unit Testing}

This section describes the approach taken with regard to system and unit testing. 

\section{Overview}
The testing for this project will be done using a unit test approach usually done through provided frameworks provided inside either Visual Studio or Xcode. Also user test will need to be conducted on the user interface since code based unit test can not be written for certain parts of the user interface, such as navigation flow. The test will be small pieces of codes ment to test small sections of code for success or points of failure. The overall goal will be to get around 80 percent code coverage and to test database response and responsiveness.

Provides a brief overview of the testing approach, testing frameworks, and general 
how testing is/will be done to provide a measure of success for the system. 



\section{Dependencies}
Currently the project contains a few known dependencies in a testing environment. The first is in the PyQt4 Python library which if changed could cause issues within the system GUI and functionality test written for it. However this seem unlikely since the main focus of PyQt updates is now focused on PyQt5. Second is the project dependence on MySQL relational database. This dependency should also be negligible since any update to MySQL are normally done with continuing compatibly with existing software in mind.

Describe the basic dependencies which should include unit testing frameworks and 
reference material. 


\section{Test Setup and Execution}
Test cases for this project were develop by the team to test specific functions and code sections and are therefore developed by the coder to test sections of the code. This can range from a print to test loops or function access to produce a full data entry or a response to test database connects and data modifications.
Depending on the type of test needed the development can take many forms. Such as specific script file test, in which case the test will execute every time the script is run until the test is removed from the code of the script. This form of test is usually used by the team to test loop or other condition statement functionality or any other one off type of code test.
Second is GUI test, user interface test will be conducted in two ways. Buttons and pathways will be manually tested, this means running the program and clicking the buttons to make sure that the window function properly. Second is the GUI's ability to connect and interact with the database in the correct manner. This is done through a combination of manual and script test.

Describe how test cases were developed, setup, and executed.  This section can 
be extremely involved if a complete list of test cases was warranted for the system.
